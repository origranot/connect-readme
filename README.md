<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Reduced.to is a URL shortener project that I have developed with the goal of providing users with shortened links for improved usability. The project is accessible at https://reduced.to.

To ensure optimal performance, I have used Redis as the cache storage mechanism. Redis is an efficient, in-memory data structure store that enables rapid retrieval of key-value pairs. By utilizing Redis, I am able to store and retrieve mappings between the short links and their corresponding long URLs in a fast and efficient manner.

One significant aspect of my project is the integration of Novu into the NestJS backend as a dynamic module. When a new user registers, I leverage the capabilities of Novu by triggering a specific event to send a verification email to the user. This verification process ensures the security and authenticity of the user's email address, thereby enhancing the overall security of the platform.

Furthermore, I have planned to integrate a widget into the project for real-time notifications regarding new link clicks created by users. This widget will enable users to receive immediate feedback and insights into the popularity of their shortened links. By leveraging real-time capabilities, I aim to enhance the user experience and provide users with valuable information about the reach and impact of their links.

In terms of data storage, I have chosen to use PostgreSQL to store user-related information. PostgreSQL is a reliable and robust open-source relational database that offers excellent data integrity and querying capabilities. By leveraging PostgreSQL, I can securely store user data while ensuring efficient retrieval and manipulation when necessary.

The frontend of the project is written in Qwik. I opted for Qwik because I am passionate about exploring new technologies and constantly striving to improve my development skills. Qwik is a cutting-edge framework that offers enhanced performance and scalability, and I am excited to leverage its capabilities to provide users with a smooth and seamless user interface.

In summary, reduced.to is a comprehensive URL shortener project that incorporates various technologies and services to ensure optimal performance, security, and user experience. Through the integration of Redis, Novu, PostgreSQL, and Qwik, I aim to deliver a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly platform for generating shortened URLs.</p>
